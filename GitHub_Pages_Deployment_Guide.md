# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for LCA Dashboard

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your LCA Dashboard on GitHub Pages, giving you a professional URL without any reference to the platform that created it.

## What You'll Need

- A GitHub account (free)
- The LCA Dashboard files (included in the zip package)
- About 10 minutes of your time

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and follow the instructions
3. Verify your email address when prompted

## Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Once logged in to GitHub, click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (suggestion: `lca-dashboard`)
4. Make sure it's set to "Public" (required for GitHub Pages)
5. Do NOT initialize with a README or add any files yet
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Upload Your Dashboard Files

After creating the repository, you'll see a page with setup instructions.

1. On this page, look for the "uploading an existing file" link and click it
2. Drag and drop all the files from the `github-pages-package` folder into the upload area
   - Make sure to include all files and folders, especially the `assets` folder and `index.html`
3. Add a commit message like "Initial dashboard upload"
4. Click "Commit changes"

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository's main page
2. Click "Settings" (tab with a gear icon)
3. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section (or look for "Pages" in the left sidebar)
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to build your site

## Step 5: Access Your Dashboard

1. After GitHub finishes building your site, refresh the GitHub Pages section
2. You'll see a message saying "Your site is published at https://yourusername.github.io/lca-dashboard/"
3. Click this link to view your dashboard
4. Bookmark this URL - this is your permanent dashboard address!

## Customizing Your URL (Optional)

If you want an even more professional URL:

1. You can purchase a custom domain (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In your repository's Settings > Pages, add your custom domain
3. Follow GitHub's instructions to set up DNS records with your domain provider

## Updating Your Dashboard Later

If you need to update your dashboard in the future:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" > "Upload files"
3. Upload the new versions of any files you want to update
4. Commit the changes
5. Your site will automatically update within a few minutes

## Troubleshooting

- If your site doesn't appear, check that you've enabled GitHub Pages correctly
- If styles or images are missing, make sure you uploaded the entire `assets` folder
- If you see a 404 error, double-check the repository name and GitHub Pages settings

Congratulations! You now have a professionally hosted LCA Dashboard with a clean GitHub URL that you can share with anyone.
